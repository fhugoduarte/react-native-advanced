# Tinder Clone Application

#### About Application:

   This application is based on the famous app **Tinder**.
   
   The application uses the React Native Animated and PanResponder API to simulate a deck with multiple cards, where the user can drag and    drop the cards, giving soft and fun effects to these actions.
   
   The components of this application were created with an idea of having      an easy reuse, and they have several properties that can be    passed so that the components adapt to the reality of any other
   application.
